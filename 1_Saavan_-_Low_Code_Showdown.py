Low-Code Showdow is a event where you will be giving multiple
rounds related to coding and the one holding the maximum total points in
the end will be declared as the winner. 

There will be less about of coding involved and more of your logical and algorithmic approach will be assessed

Our objective is to address that coding is only not about solving the
problem statement, it is also about how you approach the problem, with
minimal time complexity, identifying the errors and through a proper
algorithm.""")

üåü **Event Highlights:**

- üß† **Innovative Challenges, No Coding Required**: Step away from the intimidating world of programming languages! Our competition is designed for individuals who believe in the magic of ideas. **You won't need to write a single line of code ‚Äì all you need is your incredible imagination.**
- üß© **Engaging Problem-Solving**: Bid farewell to conventional coding competitions! The System Design Challenge is tailored for those who thrive on intellectual exploration. No coding, no design ‚Äì just your brilliant ideas at play.
- üèÜ **Judging Beyond Code**: We will evaluate your solutions based on creativity, feasibility, time taken and the impact of your ideas. It's not about how well you code; it's about how brilliantly you envision solutions. """)

There are 4 rounds in this event. They are:

- Round 1: **ALGORITHMIC THINKING** -- 1.5hr (Quiz mode) -- 25% Weightage
- Round 2: **LOGICAL THINKING** -- 1hr  (Quiz Mode) -- 20% Weightage
- Round 3: **CODE REVIEWING** -- 30min (Quiz Mode) -- 15% Weightage
- Round 4: **SYSTEM DESIGN SCENARIO** -- 12hr (work at any hour as this is submission round) -- 40% Weightage

After these 4 rounds, according to your final scores, the winner and runner up will be declared.
